# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **fix(scripts): `scripts/ingest_all.py` takes its sources from the command
  line.** Remove the built-in list of six source roots. The stale
  `cymatix_context.provenance` import had also stopped the script before
  argument parsing; it is repaired here (the module moved into the identity
  package in an earlier restructure). Missing `--sources` now prints usage and
  exits 2 unless `--sharded --agent-source` is supplied. Monolithic agent-only
  runs now error; sharded agent-only runs no longer also consider the removed
  corpus roots. Explicit-source parsing and selection are unchanged once the
  module is reachable. Test: `tests/test_ingest_all_sources.py`.

## 0.9.2 (2026-09-05)

**Ingest at scale and the #411 default flip (PRs #424, #425), a
default-inert W2.2 combinator with its kill receipt (#428), a never-swallow
fix on the harmonic tier (#432), and the 0.9.2 bench ledger (#426, #427,
#429). One default moves — `[ingestion] entity_autolink_hub_cutoff` — and it
supersedes the 0.9.1 entry below that shipped the same knob at `0`.**

- **docs: hosted-session security, RBAC, and encryption review** lands as
  `docs/reviews/2026-09-01-hosted-session-security-review.md` — read-only
  source review of the auth/identity/retrieval-scope/encryption surface for a
  hosted multi-VM deployment, with a P0/P1/P2 roadmap; pointers re-verified
  against `beta` (drift noted in-doc) and the top finding filed as #434
  (`deploy/otel` compose publishes all ports with Grafana `admin/admin` +
  anonymous Viewer). No code or default changes.
- **DEFAULT FLIP: `[ingestion] entity_autolink_hub_cutoff` `0` → `200`
  (#425, closes #411).** The 0.9.1 entry below ("default `0` = off = legacy,
  byte-identical; flip proposal tracked in #411") is superseded — a fresh
  install now drops entities with more than 200 `entity_graph` postings from
  the auto-link probe set. Both #411 flip conditions are receipted:
  (1) **retrieval null** —
  `benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/entity_hub_cutoff_retrieval_ab_enronqa_2026-08-30.json`,
  the `enronqa_bed_v2` / `v2c` cutoff twins (0 vs 200, gene-id-set digests
  identical `158fa8a3…` = content-equality proof, n=500): delivered / r@12 /
  fr@12 / median rank identical to full precision, **0/500 per-needle
  delivered flips in both the 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 configs**; (2) **post-tagger-v2
  re-measure** —
  `benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/entity_hub_cutoff_reprobe_85k_taggerv1_2026-08-30.json`
  and `…_reprobe_85k_taggerv2_2026-08-31.json`, paired 500-document read-only
  replays on content-identical 84,677-gene beds (v2 = tagger v1, v3 = tagger
  v2): tagger v2 removes 15.2% of distinct entities (239,302 → 202,844) but the
  natural hub population persists and grows slightly (`enron` 15,397 → 16,048
  postings — junk removal frees slots in the 15-entity cap); at cutoff 200,
  **0.22% of entities (441) still hold 30.1% of postings**, and the mean
  per-link call falls **4.15 → 0.42 ms** at 85k (~340× in the #412 padded-bed
  receipt). What changes on disk: which relation=5
  COVER edges form (v3 replay sample: 4,548 → 2,984 edges, 2,746 lost / 1,182
  gained) — query-inert at shipped defaults (W2.1 cover-walk kill receipt,
  #408), and the padded 597k bed built at cutoff 200 is the same bed the 0.9.1
  gate sweep certified. [BASELINES](docs/benchmarks/BASELINES.md) rows:
  `2026-08-30-entity-hub-cutoff-retrieval-ab` and
  `2026-08-31-entity-hub-cutoff-reprobe-85k`. Scope: `IngestionConfig`, shipped
  `cymatix.toml`, and `docs/config-reference.md` move to `200`; the bare
  `KnowledgeStore` kwarg
  default stays `0` (non-config constructors keep byte-identical legacy
  linking — the `rrf_k` flip pattern); the bench builder is unchanged and reads
  the cutoff only from `CYMATIX_BFM_HUB_CUTOFF`. **Opt back in to legacy
  linking: `entity_autolink_hub_cutoff = 0`.** Tests:
  `tests/test_entity_autolink_hub_cutoff.py` (default assertion flipped),
  `tests/test_config_default_honesty.py` ratchet.

- **perf(storage): `idx_filename_gene` index on `filename_index(gene_id)` +
  `KnowledgeStore(entity_autolink=False)` scheduling knob (#424) — the
  residual >150k-document ingest decay is closed.** The per-upsert
  `DELETE FROM filename_index WHERE gene_id = ?`
  (`storage/indexes.py::sync_filename_index`) was a full-table scan (`EXPLAIN`
  = `SCAN filename_index`; 571,999 rows on the finished bed), i.e. O(N) per
  insert: **42.7 ms warm scan at 572k rows vs 0.002 ms indexed (~20,000×)**.
  Receipt
  `benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/ingest_residual_decay_enronqa_2026-08-30.json`
  (the cutoff-200 full rebuild, 596,707 documents in 4h58m against a ~26h
  uncapped trajectory): the O(N²) signature is gone, worker tagging throughput
  is flat ~50 docs/s to 580k, and the writer's residual decay is linear in N
  (38.4 → 32.7 docs/s over 479k → 656k processed) — it reconciles exactly with
  the unindexed DELETE; FTS5 stays refuted (0.07% of writer wall). The index
  is content-neutral (no document, tag, or edge changes); **existing stores
  gain it on their next writable open** (the DDL pass calls
  `filename_anchor.ensure_schema`). With it, bulk builds become tagging-bound
  (~3.3 h projected for the 517k-file bed). The scheduling knob —
  `KnowledgeStore(entity_autolink=False)`, and `--no-entity-autolink` /
  `CYMATIX_BFM_ENTITY_AUTOLINK=0` on `scripts/build_fixture_matrix.py` — skips
  COVER-edge formation while still writing `entity_graph` rows (equivalence
  receipt: only default-inert relation=5 edges differ); `sync_entity_graph`
  threads it with the hub cutoff as **off > cutoff > legacy**. Default
  unchanged (auto-link on). Narrative:
  `docs/benchmarks/2026-08-30-enronqa-ingest-decay.md`. Tests:
  `tests/test_entity_autolink_schedule.py`.

- **perf(ingest): `bed_provenance` table + `cymatix diag bed`, the
  `bulk_load` SQLite memory profile, and the bench-builder commit batcher —
  port of the never-committed 2026-08-24..27 perf/ingest lane (#438;
  worktree `claude/v0-9-0-planning-dc7564`, base `5f5c677`).** Every
  writable open
  now creates the append-only `bed_provenance` table (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT
  EXISTS`; content-neutral — no document, tag, or edge changes) so a bed
  carries its own history: `scripts/stamp_bed_provenance.py` and
  `scripts/build_erb_blob_v09x.py` append build / ingest / stamp rows
  (cymatix version, git sha + dirty flag, `ingest_c`, the ingest-affecting
  config subset, gene/FTS counts, optional gene-id digest), and
  `cymatix diag bed [--db PATH] [--identity] [--json]` reads them back over a
  `mode=ro` connection with config drift between rows — the bed-identity /
  `ingest_c` house rule in `docs/benchmarks/BASELINES.md` now has code behind
  it. The snapshotted knob set includes `[ingestion]
  entity_autolink_hub_cutoff` (#411/#425, added to `beta` after this lane's
  base), since it decides which `gene_relations` relation=5 COVER edges a bed
  carries. `CYMATIX_MEM_PROFILE=bulk_load` (single-writer ingest only; NOT for the
  server) gives the writer a page cache up to 4 GiB: 64 MiB vs 4 GiB measured
  **6.47 vs 16.16 genes/s** on the 22.7 GiB ERB bed with identical write
  volume, i.e. the whole 2.5× is upsert-path lookups
  (`benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/ingest_commit_batch_ab.json`,
  `…_cache64.json`). This closes two latent breaks in beta's already-shipped
  `scripts/build_erb_blob_v09x.py`, which imports
  `cymatix_context.storage.provenance` unconditionally (ImportError after the
  multi-hour build) and defaults `--mem-profile bulk_load` (silently fell
  back to the 64 MiB `auto` cache via `_MEM_PROFILES.get(profile, auto)`).
  Bench builder `scripts/build_fixture_matrix.py` (env knobs, no
  `cymatix.toml` surface): `CYMATIX_BFM_COMMIT_BATCH` (default `0` = inert
  commit-per-gene; `K` = one durable commit per K genes with
  `CYMATIX_BFM_WAL_VALVE_MB` / `CYMATIX_BFM_RAM_FLOOR_MB` early-flush valves;
  1.234 → 0.929 write MB/gene at 5000, content-equivalent across arms),
  `CYMATIX_BFM_MAX_FILES` (deterministic prefix cap for scale curves),
  **blob-mode `--rebuild` now honoured under `--parallel`** — a killed
  parallel blob build resumes into the existing `.db` (`_filter_to_unseen`
  drops only files with durable `bfm_completed_files` markers)
  instead of losing every gene; before, blob mode always rebuilt and silently
  ignored the flag. Completion markers commit with the file's final successful
  gene, so both blob and sharded resume retry files interrupted mid-chunk-batch
  by a pause or crash. Legacy beds without markers replay through idempotent
  upserts once instead of assuming any `source_id` proves the file complete.
  The **sequential** blob path is unchanged: it walks roots
  through `ingest_tree` and never materialises a file list, so there is
  nothing for `_filter_to_unseen` to filter and `build_profile` keeps the
  historical delete-and-rebuild there (with a warning naming `--parallel`)
  rather than re-ingesting every root into a bed that already holds them.
  So `--mode blob` with no flags behaves exactly as it did before this
  entry. Parallel drains are
  **ordered** by default (`imap` rather than `imap_unordered`) so
  `gene_relations` matches the sequential path (28,767 vs 28,765 rows
  observed; `ingest_equivalence_erb.json`: content_equal=true, 4.85× at
  workers=6). Also ships `scripts/ingest_commit_batch_ab.py`,
  `scripts/sqlite_cache_ab.py`, and the `ingest_write_path_ab.json`
  (deferred-index arm: negative, 0.05×), `ingest_scale_100k_curve.csv` /
  `_250k_curve.csv` receipts. Shipped server and CLI defaults unchanged.
  Tests: `tests/test_bed_provenance.py` (17), `tests/test_mem_budget.py`
  (+2), `tests/test_build_fixture_matrix.py` (+25).

- **feat(retrieval): `eps_band_coverage` combinator — opt-in, default-inert
  (#428; W2.2-narrow, KILLED by its own receipt, kept as an arm).** Identical
  ε-band walk to `eps_band`; inside a band, distinct-query-term coverage breaks
  the tie first (then rerank, then fused, then id). Coverage is computed only
  when a query's effective combinator selects it (top-60 fused head, one
  SELECT, `coverage_tiebreak` signal), so the shipped map (all five classes →
  `eps_band`) pays nothing. `retrieval/rerank_combinators.py::VALID_COMBINATORS`
  is now the single source of truth for the combinator names (validated at
  config load and in `KnowledgeStore.__init__`, replacing a drifted literal
  tuple). The evidence for it —
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/semantic_above_gold_947k_2026-08-31.json`,
  gold out-covers the interloper majority on 16/21 rank-reachable ERB semantic
  misses — and the kill —
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/w22_coverage_kill_2026-08-31.json`, full
  470-needle arm on the 947k bed vs the floor-12 reference: **delivered 0.6681
  → 0.6681, +0/−0 paired in every class**, 0/21 audit targets converted, fr@12
  +1 needle, 67/470 final-rank moves (the mechanism ran as designed). Cause of
  death is band geometry, not signal validity: at `rrf_k = 20` the fused head
  decays ~36% relative by rank 13, so rank-13+ gold never shares an ε band with
  the top-12, and widening δ reintroduces the unbanded-additive failure wave-1
  measured (semantic r@12 0.32 → 0.16). Opt in per class with
  `rerank_combinator_by_class = { <class> = "eps_band_coverage" }`. Tests: 8
  new in the combinator suite; `tests/test_sharded_adapter_parity.py`
  whitelists `_coverage_for` (per-shard `query_docs` helper, same convention
  as `_rerank_effective` / `_score_rerank`).

- **fix(retrieval): the harmonic tier warns and skips over
  `SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER` instead of silently failing (#432, closes
  #431 tier 1).** Tier 5 binds the whole pre-shortlist candidate pool twice
  (`gene_id_a IN (...) AND gene_id_b IN (...)`). On bulk beds that pool comes
  off the unbounded tag lanes — receipt
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/harmonic_off_dilution_2026-09-01.json`
  (`harmonic_tier_liveness`, PR #429): ERB 947k median 171,745 candidates, max
  550,202, i.e. ~343k bound parameters against `SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER`
  = 32,766 — so SQLite raised `OperationalError: too many SQL variables` and
  the bare `except Exception:` swallowed it at DEBUG; the tier never fired on
  any large bed and nobody was told (a never-swallow-rule violation).
  `query_docs` now probes `connection.getlimit(SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER)`
  (new `_sqlite_variable_limit` helper, fallback 999 where `getlimit` is
  unavailable), skips the harmonic query with **one `log.warning` per store
  instance** when `2 × len(candidate_ids)` exceeds it, and the bare except now
  logs at WARNING with `exc_info`. **Ranking is byte-identical below the
  limit** — same SQL, same bonus arithmetic, same `fuser.add_tier` call, pinned
  by `tests/test_harmonic_tier_limit.py` (dict-equal `last_query_scores` /
  `last_tier_contributions` against a never-skip run). `harmonic_links` holds 0
  rows on every current bench bed, so shipped ranking is unaffected either way;
  the behavior-changing variant (bound or batch the list so Tier 5 can fire on
  large populated beds) stays open on #431.

- **fix(retrieval): the ΣĒMA vectorless auto-gate now arms by a one-shot
  probe on full-pool queries, not only on the undersized-pool cycle (port of
  campaign-branch `2259cbf`; default-inert).** The gate (`_sema_vectorless`)
  was armed exclusively from `_build_sema_cache()`, which runs only when the
  lexical tiers leave the candidate pool undersized (`len(gene_scores) <
  limit // 2`) — so on a vectorless bed whose queries always fill the pool
  (100k / 829k) it never armed and every query paid the Tier-4
  `codec.encode()` RTT for a tier that cannot produce a candidate.
  `KnowledgeStore._probe_sema_vectorless()` closes that with a single
  `SELECT 1 FROM genes WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL LIMIT 1`, memoized per
  store lifetime by `_sema_probe_done` and re-armed by
  `invalidate_sema_cache()`; a failing probe degrades to the pre-gate
  behaviour. Beds with vectors are byte-identical (the probe finds a row and
  arms nothing). **At shipped defaults this is unreachable**: `[ingestion]
  sema_embed_on_ingest = false` (#371) leaves `_sema_codec` `None`, so only
  opt-in ΣĒMA beds are affected. `ShardedGenomeAdapter` gets the matching
  no-op shim. Tests: `tests/test_sema_vectorless_gate.py` (4 new; 3 were
  red on beta before the port), plus two entity-graph delivered-set
  blast-radius regression tests in `tests/test_d8_entity_graph.py` (port of
  `cf101bc`; already green on beta, pure coverage).

- **docs: the 2026-08-09 A/B data campaign's analysis and plan are ported
  from `claude/ab-data-cymatics-pki-dff9c6`** —
  `docs/benchmarks/2026-08-09-candidate-cascade-map.md` (`daaa6af`, "PKI
  admits zero gold") and `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-09-ab-data-campaign.md`
  (`fe2ef73`/`b164be4`), each with a port-provenance block; their ~5.4 MB of
  wave0a/wave3b/wave3d ladder receipts are archived in the `cymatix-receipts`
  repository (`mirror-branches/claude__ab-data-cymatics-pki-dff9c6/`), not
  ported, and ledger Addendum 7's receipt pointer now cites that mirror.

- **bench (no default moves):**
  - **#427 — 947k `min_delivered_docs` width curve, 12 confirmed:** delivered
    **0.6298 → 0.6447 → 0.6681** at floor 0 / 6 / 12, delivered sets strictly
    nested (+7/−0, then +11/−0), map + final ranks byte-identical across all
    three arms; floor 6 forfeits 11 needles because the classifier's 8-cap
    class is never lifted (BASELINES row `2026-08-31-floor-width-curve-947k`,
    receipt `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/floor_width_curve_947k_2026-08-31.json`).
    The EnronQA paraphrase crater is closed as a lane — lexical anchor loss on
    25/31 orig-hit/rephrase-miss pairs, coverage discrimination killed for
    that corpus (`docs/benchmarks/2026-08-30-enronqa-paraphrase-crater.md`);
    the ERB semantic-cap decomposition (`semantic_vocab_gap_947k` /
    `semantic_above_gold_947k` receipts) is what revived W2.2 for #428.
  - **#426 — semantic-portfolio lane: LoCoMo(+Plus), MULocBench, and
    FinanceBench adapters + baselines** (emitter → profile → resolver → ladder,
    the EnronQA pattern; all beds tagger-v2). Baselines on shipped v0.9.1
    defaults: LoCoMo delivered 0.4348 / r@12 0.4857 (n=2,378; the cognitive
    split is a 3/401 blackout that the paper's own dense baselines fail
    identically), MULocBench delivered 0.4485 / r@12 0.4824 cold-gated (the 0.444 / 0.481 warm run is marked deprecated in `muloc_budget_ab_2026-08-31.json`; n=680; exact-commit
    subset n=70: 0.500 / 0.571), FinanceBench delivered 0.153 (n=150;
    metrics-generated 0/50 — a doc-routing blackout). **New-corpus rows, NOT
    comparable to any ERB or EnronQA row.** Receipts under
    `benchmarks/dogfood/{locomo,muloc,financebench}/receipts/`; campaign doc
    `docs/research/2026-08-31-semantic-portfolio-lane.md`; the
    `expression_tokens` 7000 → 14000 cell is NULL on both corpus families.
  - **#429 — ERB 947k Phase-1/2 admission campaign, verdict doc
    `docs/research/2026-09-01-erb-phase2-admission-verdict.md`:** the
    admission thesis LIVES with corrections — 66 of the 109 pool-absent misses
    have gold at candidate depth 1000 (pre-registered kill under 30), but depth
    never improves gold's fused rank (0 better / 38 same / 69 worse of 107) and
    a bare depth-1000 flip projects **0.634 [0.572, 0.661] vs 0.668 shipped**;
    no default moves. Receipts
    `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/pool_depth_forensics_2026-09-01.json`,
    `pool_depth_addendum_2026-09-01.json` (+ `.NOTE.md`), and the four
    `verify_a1_*_2026-09-01.json` lenses.

- **Known (0.9.2):** `[budget] min_delivered_docs` does not floor the
  TIGHT/FOCUSED budget-tier cuts (`pipeline/tier_logic.py` `candidates[:3]` /
  `candidates[:6]`, applied before the floored classifier cap): **152 of 470
  ERB 947k needles deliver 6 seats at floor 12**, including 119 of the 314
  hits, and the seat count flips 6 ↔ 12 on 33/216 needles when only admission
  knobs move — every delivery-based A/B on that bed is confounded until the
  floor reaches the tier cut. Receipt
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/verify_a1_completeness_2026-09-01.json`.
  The fix (extend the same knob to the tier cuts) changes shipped seat counts
  on ~32% of ERB needles, so it is receipt-gated and tracked in #430, not
  patched here.

**ROSETTA Tier 2 — software-lexicon aliases (spec:
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-v091-readme-wiki-rosetta-design.md`).**
Additive-only canonical-name aliases across the config, CLI, HTTP, and MCP
surfaces — every legacy bio-named surface keeps working unchanged. On the
config/env surfaces, collision (both names present) resolves legacy-wins
with a warning naming both, so no default or shipped behavior changes; the
CLI is deliberately exempt from that rule (see the `feat(cli)` entry
below — explicit dual-flag CLI input gets argparse's native last-wins
instead). Tier 3 — the wire-surface rename (`<GENE>` assembly blocks,
decoder prompts, response field names, `/stats` keys) — is out of scope
here because it alters delivered bytes; deferred to its own byte-level A/B
gate and tracked as issue #417.

- **feat(config): `[compressor]`/`[knowledge_store]` section aliases,
  `[budget]` key aliases, `CYMATIX_STORE_PATH` env alias, unknown-section
  warning (Task A1).** `cymatix_context/config.py` gains
  `_SECTION_ALIASES` (`compressor` → `ribosome`, `knowledge_store` →
  `genome`) and `_KEY_ALIASES` (`[budget] retrieval_tokens` →
  `expression_tokens`, `max_docs_per_turn` → `max_genes_per_turn`);
  `CYMATIX_STORE_PATH` aliases legacy `CYMATIX_GENOME_PATH`. Any
  top-level `cymatix.toml` section this loader doesn't recognize now
  warns via `_warn_unknown_sections` instead of vanishing silently —
  closes the sharpest pre-existing gap (an unrecognized `[compressor]`
  used to produce no signal at all). Collision rule: legacy name wins, a
  warning names both, so no default or shipped behavior changes. Review
  round 1 fixed two follow-on bugs: a `[budget]` alias/legacy collision
  was leaking a spurious "Unknown keys in [budget]" warning alongside the
  intended collision warning (the alias key is now always popped once
  handled, not only on the non-collision path), and a non-table alias
  value (e.g. `compressor = "notadict"`) was crashing `load_config` with
  `AttributeError` inside `RibosomeConfig` construction because the
  section-alias loop lacked the `isinstance` guard the key-alias loop
  already had — it now warns and leaves the section alone. That guard
  only covers the alias names; the same crash reproduces today for
  *legacy* section values (`ribosome = "notadict"`) on unmodified master
  with no Tier-2 code involved — filed separately as issue #418. Tests:
  `tests/test_lexicon_aliases_config.py`.

- **fix(api): `StatsResult` tier counts read the keys `stats()` actually
  emits (Task A2).** `CymatixSession`'s `StatsResult` construction read
  `chromatin_open`/`chromatin_euchromatin`/`chromatin_heterochromatin`,
  but `knowledge_store.stats()` emits `open`/`euchromatin`/
  `heterochromatin` — every tier count in `cymatix diag corpus` printed 0
  regardless of corpus state. Now reads the new keys with the old ones as
  fallback. Tests: `tests/test_stats_result_tiers.py`.

- **feat(cli): `cymatix document get|preview` alias, `--max-docs` flag
  alias (Task A3).** `document` is a first-class top-level subcommand in
  `dispatcher.py`, resolved to the same `cmd_gene.run` function object as
  legacy `gene` (identity-asserted in tests, not just behaviorally
  equivalent). `--max-docs` shares the `max_genes` argparse dest on
  `packet` and `refresh-targets`. CLI flags are deliberately exempt from
  the config/env legacy-wins collision rule: passing both `--max-genes`
  and `--max-docs` in one invocation is explicit user input, so
  argparse's native last-flag-wins applies as-is — pinned by
  `test_flag_alias_collision_last_wins_is_intentional_cli_exemption` plus
  a comment at each shared-dest `add_argument()` call, so the exemption
  is deliberate rather than an oversight. Tests:
  `tests/test_cli_document_alias.py`.

- **feat(server): `GET /documents/{id}` alias of `/genes/{id}` (Task
  A4).** Registered via `add_api_route` against the same handler with a
  distinct operation id, so there's no OpenAPI collision; JSON responses
  are byte-identical to `/genes/{gene_id}` for both the 200 and 404
  cases. `/genes/{gene_id}` itself is untouched. Tests:
  `tests/test_http_documents_alias.py`.

- **feat(mcp): `cymatix_document_*` tools join the lean core set, new
  `cymatix_document_neighbors`, R4 deprecation nudges (#87, Task A5).**
  `_MCP_CORE_TOOLS` grows to 11 — the five `cymatix_document_*`
  tools (`get`, `query`, `preview`, `fingerprint`, and the new
  `neighbors`) now ship in the default MCP surface alongside the
  original agent-loop five and `cymatix_announce` (added to the core set
  by the 0.9.1 model-contract work); the legacy bio-named tools stay registered
  only under `CYMATIX_MCP_FULL=1`. `cymatix_document_neighbors` is a
  pass-through-equivalent alias of `cymatix_neighbors` (same `query`/`k`
  params, same `/debug/neighbors` call). `cymatix_document_preview`'s own
  parameter is renamed `max_genes` → `max_docs` (still forwarded as
  `max_genes` on the wire) — safe since it has no prior callers pinning
  the old name; `cymatix_splice_preview` keeps `max_genes` untouched. R4
  (#87) soft-deprecation nudges added to the first docstring line of
  `cymatix_gene_get`, `cymatix_splice_preview`, and `cymatix_neighbors`,
  each naming its `cymatix_document_*` replacement — no removals. Tests:
  `tests/test_mcp_document_aliases.py`;
  `tests/test_mcp_tool_names.py`/`tests/test_mcp_server.py` updated for
  the 11-tool core. `cymatix_document_query` tracks its canonical
  original's 0.9.1 signature (`model` / `caller_model_class`, replacing
  `downstream_model`) so the alias stays signature-identical to
  `cymatix_context`.

- **docs: `mcp-tools.md` rewrite (document_* primary), alias-aware
  config-reference headings (Task A6).** `docs/api/mcp-tools.md` replaces
  a stale 1.8KB stub with the full 11-tool core (canonical names
  primary), a legacy-name back-compat table noting the R4 nudge policy,
  the 15 full-surface-only tools grouped by category, env vars (flagging
  that `CYMATIX_MCP_COMPAT` is documented but dead code), and a note that
  Tier 3 wire fields stay legacy-named for now (issue #417).
  `scripts/gen_config_reference.py` learns a canonical-heading map for
  sections with a Tier 2 alias — importing
  `cymatix_context.config._SECTION_ALIASES` off the loaded module rather
  than duplicating it — emitting `[compressor] (legacy alias:
  [ribosome])` and `[knowledge_store] (legacy alias: [genome])` headings;
  `docs/config-reference.md` regenerated, plus hand-authored prose for
  the `[budget]` key aliases (not separate dataclass fields, so the
  generated table can't express them).

- **docs(wiki): `wiki/` becomes the source of truth for both the GitHub
  wiki and cymatixcontext.com/wiki.** 15 pages (`Home`, `Getting-Started`,
  `Architecture-Map`, `Pipeline`, `Retrieval-Dimensions`, `Configuration`,
  `HTTP-API`, `CLI`, `MCP-and-IDE-Integration`, `Agent-Contract`,
  `Observability`, `Benchmarks-and-Receipts`, `Roadmap-and-Releases`,
  `Troubleshooting`, `Lexicon`) plus `_Sidebar`/`_Footer` and 4 shared SVG
  diagrams (pipeline flow, surfaces, token economics, defaults
  switchboard), all in engineering vocabulary with legacy biology terms
  called out inline. Two consumers render from the same Markdown:
  `scripts/sync_github_wiki.py` mirrors it verbatim into the
  `*.wiki` GitHub wiki repo (`--dry-run` supported), and
  `scripts/build_wiki_site.py` renders it into chrome-wrapped static HTML
  for `cymatixcontext.com/wiki/` (tag-scoped href/img-src rewrites so
  wiki-relative links and the shared SVGs resolve under the site's own
  path prefix). 14 new tests in `tests/test_build_wiki_site.py` cover the
  site-render path, including the Home-link and asset-src rewrites.
  The site render also builds a navigation sidebar from `wiki/_Sidebar.md`
  (the same file GitHub uses): a sticky desktop rail with the current page
  highlighted, collapsing to a `<details>` "Pages" block on mobile — JS-free.
- **readme: README.md rewritten 503 → 124 lines as a minimal landing
  page.** Install/quickstart/pipeline-summary/links only; the
  configuration tables, endpoint catalogue, gotchas, and lexicon detail
  that used to live in the README now live on the wiki (`Configuration`,
  `HTTP-API`, `CLI`, `Lexicon`, ...) instead of being duplicated — one
  place to keep current instead of two drifting copies.
- **docs: ROSETTA Tier-1 sweep — software-term prose pass across current
  (non-dated) docs.** Seven commits swapping biology-metaphor prose
  (gene/genome/ribosome/chromatin/splice, ...) for the canonical
  software vocabulary in `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/SETUP.md`,
  `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `docs/api/context-endpoint.md`,
  `docs/api/endpoints.md`, `docs/architecture/{DIMENSIONS,
  KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH,OBSERVABILITY,PIPELINE_LANES,SESSION_REGISTRY}.md`,
  `docs/benchmarks/BASELINES.md`, `docs/clients/cli.md`,
  `docs/config-reference.md`, `docs/operations/DENSE_VRAM.md`,
  `docs/operator-runbooks.md`, the launcher
  dashboard/database-panel templates, and `cymatix_context/mcp/server.py`'s
  tool-description strings. Dated docs (benchmarks, council verdicts,
  dated plans, `docs/archive/`) are deliberately left in their
  point-in-time vocabulary. Notable fixes carried in the same sweep
  (found while touching the surrounding prose, not a separate audit):
  - `CLAUDE.md`: `pki_enabled` default-flip date corrected
    2026-08-19 → 2026-08-17 (matches issue #370).
  - `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: issues URL corrected to
    `github.com/mbachaud/Cymatix-Context/issues` (was pointing at a
    stale fork).
  - `docs/api/endpoints.md`: `/context/packet` response shape corrected
    to the actual `ContextPacket` (`verified`/`stale_risk` buckets, not
    a per-item `verdict` field), `GET /fingerprint` corrected to
    `POST`, the non-existent `/replicate` and top-level `/compact`
    routes corrected to `/consolidate` and `/admin/compact`, `/stats`
    tier keys corrected from `chromatin_*`-prefixed to bare
    (`open`/`euchromatin`/`heterochromatin`), and the
    `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` example removed (cymatix registers no
    `/v1/messages` route — OpenAI-chat-completions-shaped only).
  - `docs/architecture/OBSERVABILITY.md`: dashboard count corrected
    6 → 7 (stale since a dashboard was added).
  - `docs/api/context-endpoint.md`: `know_decision.py` /
    `know_calibration.py` source links repointed to their current
    `cymatix_context/scoring/` location (post-restructure dead links).
  - `docs/benchmarks/BASELINES.md`: de-duplicated a repeated
    `sema-readgate-decider` row.
  - `docs/architecture/KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md`: ASCII diagrams translated
    to engineering vocabulary (padding/headings preserved).
  - `docs/operator-runbooks.md`: a chromatin SQL literal (an actual
    column value, not prose) restored after an earlier pass
    over-translated it.
- **docs: `docs/ROSETTA.md` retires to a stub.** The full
  biology-to-software lexicon table moves to the wiki's `Lexicon` page
  (mirrored to both `github.com/mbachaud/Cymatix-Context/wiki/Lexicon`
  and `cymatixcontext.com/wiki/lexicon/`); the stub links there, links
  the Agentome paper (<https://mbachaud.substack.com/p/agentome>) for
  the "why biology in the first place" backstory, and tracks the
  remaining un-renamed wire/SQL surface (`gene_id`, the `genes` table,
  `/stats` keys, the legacy `<GENE .../>` inline tag — intentionally
  not renamed to avoid an on-the-wire break) on issue #417. `CLAUDE.md`
  pointers updated to match.
- **docs:** the wiki pages treat PR #419's canonical spellings as primary;
  that branch is merged into this one, so the two land in either order.
- **process: beta-branch release flow.** `beta` is the standing integration
  branch and, since 2026-09-01, the repository's **default branch** — new pull
  requests and fresh clones land on it. `master` holds released code and tags
  only; releases are `release/vX.Y.Z` cuts from `beta` merged to `master` by
  PR, hotfixes are `hotfix/*` from `master` back-merged into `beta`. CI runs on
  pushes to `beta` and `release/**` and on PRs targeting `beta` (master
  unchanged); `cla.yml` was already unfiltered. A sixth CI job,
  `release-source`, fails a pull request to `master` whose head is not
  `release/**` or `hotfix/**`, and is scoped by a job-level `if` to PRs against
  `master` so `beta` pushes and `beta` PRs skip it. **Branch protection is
  applied** on both branches (classic, `enforce_admins` false, no force-push,
  no deletion): `beta` requires `contributor-signup` plus the five test jobs;
  `master` requires those six plus `release-source` and a pull request with 0
  approvals. Pre-releases (`vX.Y.ZbN` on `beta`, GitHub pre-release,
  `publish.yml` to PyPI, `pip install --pre cymatix-context`) are the new way
  to ship an integration snapshot. Runbook: `docs/RELEASING.md` (branch model,
  receipt gate, exact commands, and the applied protection JSON as the reapply
  record); helper: `scripts/release.py` (`check` / `pre --n N` /
  `final --version X.Y.Z` / `tag-message [--body-only]`, dry-run by default,
  never runs git itself; `tests/test_release_script.py`); PR template
  `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`; `CONTRIBUTING.md` "Branches and
  releases".
- **ci: ruff error-gate + `[nli]` extra in the full-suite job.** New fast
  `lint` job runs `ruff check --select E9,F63,F7,F82 .` (syntax errors,
  invalid comparisons, logic errors, undefined names — deliberately not a
  style linter; the selection is pinned in `[tool.ruff.lint]` so local
  `ruff check .` and CI agree). `test-full-suite` now installs
  `.[dev,ast,mcp,nli]` so the fully-mocked transformers-gated tests (incl.
  the #341 rerank device-routing test) stop silently skipping — torch is
  already the CPU wheel, so no CUDA wheel is pulled in. The gate's only
  hits on `beta` were 4 annotation-only forward references
  (`knowledge_store.py` `BGEM3Codec`/`np`, `tagger.py` `IntentClass`,
  `tests/conftest.py` `TestClient`), fixed with `TYPE_CHECKING` imports —
  no runtime import changes. Ported from the 2026-08-08 audit branch
  (`claude/codebase-audit-weaknesses-96a7da`, c193c20 + the f2b8a06
  `knowledge_store.py` rider).
- **bench: `benchmarks/bench_cymatix_rag_composition.py` imports repaired.**
  The script still imported `cymatix_context.lexical_rescue` /
  `chunk_fetch` / `relevance_window`, which moved under `retrieval/` and
  `encoding/` in the #90 restructure — it has been import-broken since.
  Repointed at the current module locations. `bench_needle.py` and
  `bench_claude_matrix.py`: `helix-context/helix.toml` restored as the gold
  label for the 11 toml needles — the frozen bench beds predate the 0.8.5
  rename, so the codemodded `helix-context/cymatix.toml` label matched no
  bed (`docs/benchmarks/MULTI_VALID_GOLD.md`); `cymatix.toml` stays as an
  ANY-match sibling for post-rename beds. Ported from audit commit 5c12c16
  minus its `ablate_cymatics.py` "peak_width is inert" annotation (false
  since #357 wired the knob; beta already carries the #354/#357 label fix).
- **chore: dead code removed.** `scripts/codemod_cymatix_rename.py`
  (self-neutralized since the 0.8.5 clean break — `OLD_PKG == NEW_PKG`;
  working version recoverable at 2e3f90e), `scripts/_write_tcm.py` (4-line
  dead scaffold), and `filename_anchor.remove_gene` (zero callers).
  Document deletes already sweep `filename_index` via
  `KnowledgeStore.delete_gene`'s `optional_tables` loop; the new
  `tests/test_filename_index_delete.py` pins that so it cannot regress
  silently. Ported from audit commit 363f700. Not ported from that branch:
  **f2b8a06 (concurrency) — deferred, not superseded**: only its
  `knowledge_store.py` `TYPE_CHECKING` rider is here (see the ci entry
  above), and three fixes it carries are still absent on `beta` — the SPLADE
  `_ensure_loaded` first-load lock (`splade_backend.py:112-142`, N-thread
  cold start constructs the model N times), the bounded freshness mtime
  cache with its `/admin/refresh` clear (`freshness.py:133,145` grow for the
  process lifetime; `routes_admin.py:653-658` never clears the cache that
  `context_manager.py:1211` documents it as clearing), and `blend.py`'s
  copy-under-lock score-map publication (`blend.py:204-207,235,283` still
  alias the #350 request-local dict into the shared
  `genome.last_query_scores`, plus the unlocked cold-tier write at
  `knowledge_store.py:1571-1574`). They need a hand re-apply against #350
  rather than a cherry-pick — **tracked in #439**. 44d0327 (docs) is
  genuinely superseded — stale claims retired by #354/#388, #357, #396 and
  865d34d — as is the README "Security" section, where the wiki
  `Configuration` and `HTTP-API` pages already carry a fuller, current
  equivalent.

- **bench: beta witness sweep + four new code corpora (2026-09-04).**
  `benchmarks/dogfood/sweeps/run_sweep_beta.py` re-ran every frozen v0.9.1
  receipt on the beta head `21606a0`: bit-exact on LoCoMo, FinanceBench,
  EnronQA v2 and EnronQA padded (with the 947k check: five corpora, 3,998
  paired needles, zero field diffs). MULoc's residual movement is the
  `PYTHONHASHSEED` hazard in `filename_anchor.py:164` (`list({...})[:64]`):
  139/141 movers are >64-term queries and seed 1 vs 0 alone moves 165, so the
  runner now pins and records the seed. RepoBench-R python reproduces the
  June arm; Java is measured for the first time. Four new code beds land with
  builders (`scripts/build_{coderag,cosqa,swebench}_corpus.py`), a generic
  gold resolver (`scripts/resolve_bench_needles.py`), fixture profiles, a
  document-level BM25 foil (`benchmarks/dogfood/code/bm25_doc_foil.py`) and
  their own BASELINES rows: CodeRAG-Bench solutions + docs, CoIR CosQA,
  SWE-bench Verified. Two defects surfaced and are tracked separately, no
  default moves: queries with >500 Stage-1 terms raise through
  `build_context` (Tier-2 UNION ALL vs `SQLITE_LIMIT_COMPOUND_SELECT`), and
  the Tier-1/2 tag lanes cost 12–25 NDCG@10 points on small-file code corpora
  under RRF (diagnostic arms). Write-up
  `docs/benchmarks/2026-09-04-beta-witness-sweep.md`.

## 0.9.1 (2026-08-30)

The retrieval-quality release: wave-1 ranking graduation (rrf_k 60→20 +
all-five-classes eps_band) and the W2.4 delivered-seat floor
(min_delivered_docs 0→12) ship as defaults, each receipt-gated on paired
delivered-basis evidence across ERB and the new EnronQA second-corpus
bench lane (gate receipt:
benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/sweep_v091_gate_2026-08-30.json, ALL PASS).
Ingest at scale: entity auto-link hub cutoff (default-off knob, ~340×
per-link-call, retrieval-null A/B) and tagger v2 entity hygiene
(TAGGER_VERSION=2, bed-comparability versioned). Cross-host client
unification (#406). Release gate: PRs #406–#409, #412, #413, #422.

- **tagger v2 — entity hygiene (#410), bed-comparability break.** The CPU
  tagger no longer emits email/MIME plumbing as entities: entities containing
  newlines/tabs are rejected, and standard header field names
  (`content-type`, `mime-version`, …), RFC 822 `x-*` extension headers, and
  transport artifacts (`javamail`, `quoted-printable`, …) are denylisted.
  Root cause of the EnronQA `entity_graph` hubs that made per-insert entity
  auto-linking O(N²) at build time (receipt
  `benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/ingest_decay_enronqa_2026-08-30.json`).
  Because tags are part of the bed-content digest, this ships as
  `TAGGER_VERSION = 2` (`cymatix_context/tagger.py`), recorded per bed in the
  fixture-matrix manifest; beds built at different tagger versions are not
  cross-comparable (rule added to `docs/benchmarks/BASELINES.md`). Fresh
  before/after receipt:
  `benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/tagger_v2_entity_hygiene_2026-08-30.json`.


- **perf(storage): `[ingestion] entity_autolink_hub_cutoff` — posting-count
  hub cutoff for entity auto-linking (default `0` = off = legacy,
  byte-identical; flip proposal tracked in #411).** The 2026-08-30 enronqa_padded profiling receipt
  (`benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/ingest_decay_enronqa_2026-08-30.json`)
  measured `auto_link_by_entity` at 89.5% of writer wall time — the
  per-insert GROUP BY sweeps every posting row of every probe entity, and
  MIME-header hubs (`content-type` 171k+ rows) make that O(N²) per build
  (148.9 ms/insert vs 7.4 ms without the two hubs). With the cutoff > 0,
  entities whose `entity_graph` posting count exceeds it are dropped from
  the probe set before the GROUP BY (`PKI_NOISE_CUTOFF` precedent —
  cardinality strictly greater is skipped); the count probe is
  LIMIT-bounded, so per-insert cost is O(n_entities × cutoff). This
  changes which relation=5 COVER edges form (default-inert at query time —
  W2.1 cover-walk kill receipt), so the flip proposal ships behind the
  default-off knob with an A/B edge-delta + perf receipt
  (`benchmarks/dogfood/receipts/entity_hub_cutoff_ab_enronqa_2026-08-30.json`,
  `scripts/receipt_entity_hub_cutoff.py`).


- **`[budget] min_delivered_docs` GRADUATED 0 → 12 (`[w24-floor-flip]`).**
  The W2.4 delivered-seat floor is now a shipped default: the classifier's
  per-rule assembly cap is lifted to at least 12 seats and the Stage-5
  budget trimmer truncates the largest parts instead of evicting whole
  documents (token budget still wins last — eviction resumes below the
  floor on overflow). Receipt-gated on three corpora with zero paired
  delivered losses: ERB 829k .630→.668 (+18/−0,
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/ladder_v09x_w24_min_delivered_2026-08-28.json`),
  EnronQA v2 .820→.856 (+18/−0) and EnronQA padded 597k .776→.792
  (+8/−0) (BASELINES row `2026-08-30-v091-gate-sweep`); r@12/fr@12
  identical in every cell. `min_delivered_docs = 0` restores legacy;
  revert = `git revert` of the `[w24-floor-flip]` commit.
## 0.9.0 (2026-08-20)

The post-flip release: the shipped default retrieval path is now fully
algorithmic — `dense_embedding_enabled`, `splade_enabled`, `pki_enabled`,
`dense_embed_on_ingest`, and `sema_embed_on_ingest` all default `false`,
each flip receipt-gated (entries below). Release-gate tracker: #377.

**Release-notes disclosures:**

- **know surface:** KnowBlock never fires at shipped defaults (max confidence
  ≈0.28 vs emit_floor 0.45; the `lexical_dense_agree` calibration feature is
  structurally dead on the neural-free path) — fail-safe direction (0%
  false-KNOW); recalibration tracked as #287 in the 0.9.x backlog (receipts:
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/postflip_know_abstain_sanity_*.json`).
- **p50 latency:** the dense-off default carries the measured p50 regression
  disclosed under #374 (see the `dense_embedding_enabled` entry below —
  ×2.5–2.6 at 100k shrinking to ×1.09–1.38 at 829k); the mitigation (lex-branch
  candidate cap) has not landed and stays open on the retrieval-layer ledger.

**Known deferred (0.9.x):**

- Deferred work is sequenced in #377's 0.9.x deferral-ledger comment
  (2026-08-19) — #366, #349, #344, #340, #336, #287, #275, #260, #205, #373,
  #356, #355, plus the #351 knob decisions.
- entity_graph layer ships ON but has never been ablated on the delivered
  basis (ledger REMOVE-CANDIDATE); the arm is tracked in #377's 0.9.x backlog.

**Ops:**

- **ops(beds): 2026-08-20 bench-bed maintenance** — 36.6 GB reclaimed across
  the two 829k benchmark beds (`path_key_index` drop + FTS5 external-content
  migration + vacuum); receipt-comparability flag recorded on #370; new bed
  bytes and reproduction notes in `docs/benchmarks/BASELINES.md`
  (bed-state note, 2026-08-20).
- **security: `[budget] neutralize_control_tags` default flipped `false` →
  `true` (#351 decision 2).** Scope: assembly-time escaping of `<cymatix:`
  control tags in retrieved content — a document whose content contains the
  literal `<cymatix:` can no longer forge the genuine
  `<cymatix:no_match/>` / `<cymatix:slate>` control tags that downstream
  agents adopting `CYMATIX_NO_MATCH_FRAGMENT` trust (the escape rewrites it
  to `&lt;cymatix:`; the genuine no-match tag, emitted on the separate
  parts-empty branch, is never escaped). The escape runs strictly AFTER
  retrieval/fusion/tie-break/rank publication, so retrieval metrics are
  unchangeable by construction; the flip gate was the delivered basis and
  assembled bytes. Receipt
  (`benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/neutralize_ab_100k.json`, 141-needle
  100k-carve replay, both arms explicit): r@12 0.6879 = 0.6879, fr@12
  0.6950 = 0.6950, delivered_gold_rate 0.6099 = 0.6099, per-needle
  ranks/delivered ids identical, **141/141 windows byte-identical**, and
  the 5 genuine abstain-tag windows untouched in both arms. The bed carries
  zero control-tag docs (receipt `bed_control_tag_scan`), so the positive
  case — the escape fires where a tag exists and only there — is carried by
  the synthetic assembly-function A/B unit tests in
  `tests/test_control_tag_neutralization.py`. Opt out with
  `neutralize_control_tags = false` (documents legitimately containing the
  literal `<cymatix:` string then ship verbatim — byte-identical to
  pre-knob behavior). Scope limit unchanged: closes tag forgery only;
  general indirect prompt injection via document text is inherent to
  context injection.
- **security: startup warning on non-loopback bind with empty
  `admin_token` (#351 decision 1).** `create_app` now logs a prominent
  `NETWORK-EXPOSED ADMIN SURFACE` warning when `[server] host` is not
  loopback (`127.0.0.1` / `localhost` / `::1`) while `[server] admin_token`
  is empty — that configuration leaves `/admin/*` (including
  `/admin/shutdown` and `/admin/swap-db`), `/ingest` and `/consolidate`
  reachable by anyone on the network with no authentication. Warning only:
  the bind is honored unchanged, loopback binds and token-set configs stay
  silent.

- **ingestion: `[ingestion] sema_embed_on_ingest` default flipped `true` →
  `false` (#371).** Ingest-time behavior change only — this completes #371's
  sema half (the dense half is the entry below). Consumer audit first
  (PR #399): at shipped defaults the ONLY live retrieval-path consumer of
  `gene.embedding` is the Tier-4 `sema_boost` re-rank — cymatics reads tags
  (`[cymatics] use_embeddings` off), cold tier is opt-in, TCM's tag-hash
  fallback is clean, and the freshness gate / packet know/PLR read no
  embeddings. Deciding cell (PR #400,
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/sema_readgate_829k_n469.json` — `no_sema`
  read-gate arm on the 829k bed, n=469, delivered basis, paired per-needle):
  a wash — delivered gold 264/469 → 265/469 (+1 needle), r@12/fr@12/median/
  mean rank byte-identical, 0 recall flips, 0 final-rank moves, abstain set
  byte-identical (16/469, all pre-existing). The dogfood-scale A/B (PR #399,
  n=18) had measured −2 delivered needles (one `[abstain]` floor coupling,
  one budget-boundary cut); the coupling does not reproduce at 829k. Riders:
  cold start −~9.7 s (the SEMA/MiniLM load was 97.7% of first-request
  latency, `cold_start_postflip.json`), ingest wall 835.9 s → 761.5 s on the
  1,181-file dogfood corpus, −0.48% bed bytes. Re-opt-in story: set
  `sema_embed_on_ingest = true` — new ingests embed; docs ingested while the
  knob was off have NULL `gene.embedding` until `scripts/backfill_sema.py`
  (or re-ingest/consolidate), and TCM's tag-hash fallback covers vectorless
  docs by design (#227). Explicit `sema_embed_on_ingest = true` configs keep
  their behavior. Follow-up (not a flip blocker): `[abstain]`
  floor-recalibration is tracked on #371's closing comment / the #377
  ledger — 13/16 delivered-adjacent floor abstains pre-exist at shipped
  defaults and are not moved by this knob.
- **ingestion: `[ingestion] dense_embed_on_ingest` default flipped `true` →
  `false` (#371).** Ingest-time behavior change only — retrieval is untouched:
  at shipped defaults (`[retrieval] dense_embedding_enabled = false` since
  2026-08-15) nothing reads `embedding_dense_v2`, and the sharded read path
  hard-wires dense off, so the inline BGE-M3 encode (~2 GB model load, one
  *unbatched* extra encode per multi-chunk file for the layered-fingerprint
  parent) was a dead write. PR #379's harness smoke
  (`benchmarks/dogfood/run_ingest_throughput.py`, 12 files, CPU encode):
  defaults 126.8 s wall / 4084 ms steady per-file / 3.47 GB peak RSS vs
  `no_dense_ingest` 20.9 s / 494 ms / 0.82 GB — a 6.1× wall speedup and
  −2.6 GB RSS from this knob alone. Re-opt-in story: set
  `dense_embed_on_ingest = true` to resume writing vectors at ingest; docs
  ingested while the knob was off have NULL vectors, so re-enabling dense
  RETRIEVAL on such a bed additionally requires `scripts/backfill_bgem3_v2.py`.
  Existing beds with backfilled vectors are unaffected, and explicit
  `dense_embed_on_ingest = true` configs keep their behavior. The sema half of
  #371 (`sema_embed_on_ingest`) was deliberately NOT flipped here — it
  needed its own receipt, which landed via PRs #399/#400 (see the entry
  above).
- **config: #219 slice 5 — dark-feature labels, dead-knob removal, and the
  `[plr] expected_sha256` wiring gap.** The default-honesty pass for knobs
  the loader accepted but the runtime ignored or half-honored:
  - **Removed five dead knobs** (parsed with ZERO runtime readers — verified
    repo-wide, the only Python references were `config.py`'s own parse
    lines): `[ingestion] colbert_enabled` (Phase-4 scaffold, never
    implemented), `[retrieval] seeded_edge_weight` (the seed-insertion
    weight is hardcoded `0.7 + 0.3*cos` in
    `scripts/backfill_seeded_edges.py`), and `[cymatics] n_bins` /
    `use_embeddings` / `splice_threshold_scale` (the spectrum resolution is
    the module constant `scoring/cymatics.N_BINS`; the splice threshold
    derives from `[budget] splice_aggressiveness`; no embedding path ever
    read `use_embeddings`). The loader warns-and-ignores unknown keys
    (`_warn_unknown`), so existing configs still carrying them get a startup
    WARNING, not a failure — remove the lines to silence it.
  - **Wired `[plr] expected_sha256`** (previously parsed but never passed):
    the server's `get_fuser` call now threads the configured pin through to
    `StackedPLRFuser.load`, so an operator-pinned artifact hash actually
    verifies and a mismatch refuses to load (PLR soft-fails to
    "unavailable", packets ship without `plr_confidence`). Byte-identical at
    the shipped default `""` — empty falls back to the sidecar-`.sha256`
    path exactly as before.
  - **Labeled the three dark-but-wired features EXPERIMENTAL** with evidence
    and graduation criteria instead of bare "Dark ship" comments:
    `[retrieval] sr_enabled` (measured zero retrieval effect),
    `ray_trace_theta` (requires a TCM velocity input the default pipeline
    does not populate; never measured), `seeded_edges_enabled` (starts
    evidence writes on every retrieval; never measured). All three stay
    default-off; each graduates only with a fresh isolation receipt.
  - `docs/config-reference.md` regenerated; its "Default cymatix.toml"
    appendix no longer shows `sr_enabled = true` (stale since the
    2026-06-12 honesty pass).

- **retrieval: `[retrieval] pki_enabled` default flipped `true` → `false`
  (#370).** The 829k exact-shipped-default confirm at full statistical power
  (n=469, delivered basis,
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/postflip_default_confirm_829k.json`)
  measured PKI on as **−1 delivered needle** vs `no_pki` (263/469 = 0.5608 vs
  264/469 = 0.5629; r@12 0.6546 vs 0.6588, fr@12 0.6588 vs 0.6631) —
  null-to-hair-negative. Honest caveat: the earlier n=30 cells were
  delivered-identical at 250k/500k/829k-probe but the 100k cell was **+1
  delivered needle for PKI** (the one positive cell, replicated in both run
  orders); the full-power n=469 cell is −1. Opt back in per store with
  `pki_enabled = true` — one config line. Note the flip does NOT reclaim the
  8.56 GB `path_key_index` on existing beds; the scorer-neutral compaction is
  #370's other checkbox and stays open. Receipts:
  `docs/benchmarks/2026-08-14-encoder-isolation-scale-curve.md`.
- **feat(mcp): migrate the MCP server to mcp 2.x and lift the #325 pin (#326).**
  `cymatix_context/mcp/mcp_server.py` now uses `mcp.server.mcpserver.MCPServer`
  (2.x home of the removed `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP`); requirement is
  `mcp>=2,<3` in both the `mcp` and `all` extras. Tool surface is unchanged —
  lean 5-tool core, `CYMATIX_MCP_FULL=1` opt-in, schemas byte-identical vs 1.x.
  Spec: `docs/design/2026-08-16-mcp-2x-migration.md`.

- **ingestion: `[ingestion] splade_enabled` default flipped `true` → `false`.**
  The n=469 isolation receipts on the 829k blob measured query-side SPLADE
  over the full 147M-row expansion index as null-to-negative vs the lexical
  floor (pool −0.004, delivered −0.006, ~15% slower; both repeats identical),
  and the ingest-side bed A/B showed the expansion index contributes nothing
  passively — the all-off floor is byte-identical with and without it. With
  dense also flipped (below), **the default retrieval path is now fully
  neural-free**. Opt back in per store with `splade_enabled = true`; existing
  beds keep their expansion tables (unused until opted in). Receipts:
  `docs/benchmarks/2026-08-14-encoder-isolation-scale-curve.md`.
- **retrieval: `[retrieval] dense_embedding_enabled` default flipped `true` →
  `false`.** Four-scale isolation receipts (100k/250k/500k carves + the 829k
  blob at the full 469-needle set, every order-reversed pair replicated
  exactly) measured BGE-M3 dense recall *displacing gold documents from the
  delivered top-k* at every scale — final recall −0.20..−0.33 vs the lexical
  floor (−0.207 at n=469, ~97/469 needles) — while adding at most +0.02
  candidate-pool recall. **Disclosed cost (#374):** the same receipts measure
  a p50 latency regression from the flip — the dense-off floor is **×2.5–2.6
  slower than dense_on at 100k** (p50 10.4s/9.7s vs 3.9s/3.8s,
  `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/enc_iso_100k_run{1_fwd,2_rev}.json`),
  ×2.3–2.4 at 250k, ×1.27–1.37 at 500k, and ×1.09–1.10 at 829k on the n=30
  pairs (×1.15–1.38 on the full-power n=469
  `enc_iso_829k_dense_confirm_run{1,2}.json` pair). Mechanism (retrieval-layer
  ledger claim 1, `docs/benchmarks/2026-08-06-retrieval-layer-ledger.md`):
  dense was load-bearing as a *latency device* — its ANN gate capped the
  candidate list feeding splice, and dense-off degrades the median query to an
  uncapped lex pool. The ledger's precondition — "cap the non-ANN branch's
  candidate list before dense-skip is viable" — has **not** landed (the
  2026-08-12 refinement plan kept dense load-bearing until it did); the
  lex-branch cap stays open in the ledger's claim-1 line, alongside the
  related #336 splice char-target dynamics. Dense is now opt-in per store; beds with backfilled
  vectors are unaffected until you set the flag. Existing configs that
  explicitly set `dense_embedding_enabled = true` keep their behavior.
  Receipts + method: `docs/benchmarks/2026-08-14-encoder-isolation-scale-curve.md`.

- **perf(storage): #338 FTS5 external-content rebuild.** `genes_fts` no longer
  stores its own full copy of every document (the `genes_fts_content` shadow —
  8.67 GB / 18.5% of the 829K blob bed): new stores are created as
  external-content FTS5 backed by the `genes_fts_source` view, which reproduces
  the exact composite text the contentful table indexed, so tokenizer, BM25
  stats, and reader queries are unchanged (receipted byte-identical on the ERB
  10k bed: `benchmarks/dogfood/erb/receipts/fts5_external_content_migration_10k.json`).
  Legacy contentful stores keep working untouched;
  `scripts/migrate_fts5_external_content.py` converts them offline (idempotent,
  `--dry-run`, `--vacuum`). Write paths follow the external-content
  delete-with-prior-values discipline; `rebuild_fts` uses the FTS5 `'rebuild'`
  command on migrated stores. **Stub caveat** (cc-exchange 0017-joe §6): the
  contentful shadow accidentally retained pre-compression original text for
  stubbed genes; the migration refuses on stub-bearing stores unless
  `--allow-stub-loss` is passed — signal-neutrality is conditional on a
  stub-free store.

- **feat: query-time cross-encoder rerank, default-off (#341).** New
  `[retrieval] rerank_enabled` (default `false`), `rerank_depth` (`50`),
  `rerank_model` (`"cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2"`) and
  `rerank_enabled_by_class` (`{}`, the #255 per-class map). The cross-encoder
  runs **pre-cap** inside the knowledge store (`query_docs_ann` pre-gate;
  `query_docs` post-fusion on the dense-off profile) and is
  count-preserving — the store returns the same number of documents either
  way, only membership and order change. `[hardware] rerank_device` is now
  actually consumed (`resolve_layer_device("rerank")` at model load). The
  encoder daemon gained `POST /encode/rerank` with
  `EncoderClient.encode_rerank` and a `rerank_backend` remote branch at
  circuit/ready-gate/fallback parity with the SPLADE seam; `/ready` now
  waits on the rerank family too. Default-off is deliberate: it pays only on
  populations with near-cutoff rerank headroom, and costs ~270–560ms/query on
  a GPU daemon at 829k documents (~285–315ms at 100k). Receipts and the
  population caveat:
  `docs/benchmarks/2026-08-07-rerank-wiring-receipts.md`.

- **Breaking: removed `[ingestion] rerank_enabled`.** The knob was dead or
  wrong on every backend: under `deberta` the serving path looked for a
  `rerank` attribute while `DeBERTaRibosome` only defines `re_rank`, so the
  cross-encoder never ran; under `ollama`/`litellm` it misrouted to the LLM
  `Compressor.rerank`. The post-cap branch in `scoring/blend.py` is gone with
  it. **Configs that set it now get no rerank** unless they also set
  `[retrieval] rerank_enabled = true`. `[ingestion] rerank_model` is
  unchanged (still the legacy DeBERTa constructor input).

## 0.8.6 — 2026-08-05

GPU encoder daemon, executor sizing, ERB scale fixes. (This header was added
retroactively on 2026-08-14 — the tag and GitHub Release shipped 2026-08-05/06
without a changelog section.)

- **feat: `[encoder_daemon]` — shared GPU encoder daemon (fork1 slice 1).**
  New `cymatix_context.encoder_daemon` FastAPI process (default port 11439)
  with an `EncoderRegistry` + per-family micro-batcher; dense/SPLADE/SEMA
  seams route through it when `[encoder_daemon] url` (or
  `CYMATIX_ENCODER_URL`) is set, byte-identical when off. Client side ships
  `RemoteBGEM3Codec`/`RemoteSemaCodec` drop-ins with URL resolution, a circuit
  breaker, readiness gating, and text-count-scaled batch timeouts.
  `CYMATIX_ENCODER_BATCH_WINDOW_MS` default lowered 8 ms → 2 ms
  (receipt-driven).
- **perf(hardware): per-layer encoder device knobs + CUDA A/B** — BGE-M3
  22.7× batched on a 3080 Ti; deconfounded GPU-vs-CPU ladder receipts
  (−41% at dogfood scale, wash at ERB scale). GPU-daemon worker sweep found
  the x4 executor sweet spot.
- **feat(retrieval): #327 `authority_path_selectivity` knob** (default-off —
  it regresses alone; the seam landed, not the fix).
- **fix(server): #329 three-state upstream health** — an inactive ribosome no
  longer degrades `/health`.
- **bench(erb): per-layer ablation ladder + storage audit** — 7 arms survive
  gate verification (3 dropped ungateable, 3 identity); blob-scale storage
  audit receipts.

## 0.8.5 — 2026-07-25

Completes the helix → cymatix rename as a **clean break** (0.8.0 was the soft
rename; 0.8.5 removes all of its back-compat). **Breaking:** if you still use
the old names, migrate or pin `cymatix-context<0.8.5` (0.8.0 keeps the aliases).

- **rename: removed all helix back-compat.** Deleted the `helix_context` alias
  package (`import helix_context` now raises `ModuleNotFoundError`), the `helix*`
  console scripts, the `helix_*` MCP tool aliases (and the `CYMATIX_MCP_COMPAT`
  machinery), the `CYMATIX_*→HELIX_*` env mirror (internal reads are `CYMATIX_*`
  only), and the `helix.toml` config fallback (`cymatix.toml` / `$CYMATIX_CONFIG`
  only). The MCP surface is the 5 canonical `cymatix_*` core tools, no aliases.

- **rename: internal identifiers + observability.** `Helix*` classes → `Cymatix*`
  (`CymatixConfig`, `CymatixContextManager`, `CymatixError`, `CymatixSession`);
  loggers `helix.*` → `cymatix.*`; OTel metrics `helix_*` → `cymatix_*`, spans
  `helix.pipeline.*` → `cymatix.pipeline.*`, and the 7 Grafana dashboards
  (uids/titles/queries) renamed to match; agent protocol tags `<helix:…>` →
  `<cymatix:…>`; portable bundle format is now `.cymatix` /
  `cymatix_format_version` (import still accepts the legacy `helix_format_version`
  key).

- **compat: data stays readable.** Existing `genome.db` opens unchanged; new
  launcher/observability state lands under `~/.cymatix` / `cymatix-context` with
  a read-fallback to the old `~/.helix` / `helix-context` locations.

- **feat: `cymatix_context.__version__`.** Single-source version export (pinned
  to `pyproject.toml` by test); `/health` carries a `version` field.

- **ci: full offline suite job.** `pytest tests/ -m "not live"` (~3.4k tests)
  runs on every push/PR (the eager app lives only in `_asgi.py`).

- **docs: drop dangling `*_DAEMON_DESIGN.md` pointers.** References now point at
  `cymatix-server` for the long-lived HTTP surface.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-22

- **rename: helix-context → cymatix-context.** Canonical package is now
  `cymatix_context`; the old `helix_context` package is a live alias —
  every submodule import resolves to the identical `cymatix_context`
  module object (no copies, isinstance-safe) and emits a
  `DeprecationWarning`. CLI entry points are now `cymatix`/`cymatix-server`/
  `cymatix-launcher`/`cymatix-status`/`cymatix-vault`, with the old
  `helix*` names kept as console-script aliases. Env vars: `CYMATIX_*` is
  canonical and mirrored to `HELIX_*` unless an explicit `HELIX_*` value
  is already set (old deployments untouched). Config: `cymatix.toml` is
  canonical, `helix.toml` still loads as a fallback. MCP server identifies
  as `cymatix` (was `helix`) — a client-visible tool-namespace change.
  OTel `service.name` is now `cymatix-context`; metric names, logger
  names, and dashboard UIDs are deliberately unchanged. The wheel ships
  both packages. Knowledge-store format is unchanged — no re-ingest
  needed.

- **rename: Windows launcher surface follows the 0.8.0 cymatix rename.**
  `setup-helix.bat` → `setup-cymatix.bat`, `start-helix-tray.bat` →
  `start-cymatix-tray.bat`, `start-helix-mcpo.bat` →
  `start-cymatix-mcpo.bat`, `deploy/windows/setup-helix.ps1` →
  `setup-cymatix.ps1`; thin forwarders remain at the old .bat names for
  the deprecation window. The launchers now invoke
  `python -m cymatix_context.*` directly and set the canonical
  `CYMATIX_*` env vars (adopting any `HELIX_*` already present in the
  shell, so old-prefix deployments are untouched) — this makes the
  SETUP.md claims about which vars the tray bat sets actually true.
  Setup now creates/refreshes `Cymatix` shortcuts and retires stale
  repo-local `Helix` ones; the NSSM service recipe
  (`deploy/windows/README.md`) moves to `cymatix-launcher` /
  `CymatixLauncher`. Also adds the `*.local.bat` gitignore rule the
  launcher comments always promised.

- **rename: CLI `--help` surfaces follow the invoked alias.** Subcommand
  parsers hardcoded `prog="helix <sub>"`, so `cymatix query --help` printed
  `usage: helix query`. All nine subcommands, `cymatix-status`,
  `cymatix-vault`, and `cymatix-launcher` now derive prog from argv[0]
  (`cli.dispatcher.invoked_prog`) — the `cymatix` entry points brand
  themselves cymatix while the deprecated `helix*` aliases keep showing
  the name they were invoked as. Help descriptions drop the helix brand.

- **fix(sharding): mirror the WS2 symbol-graph + delete surface on
  `ShardedGenomeAdapter`.** `KnowledgeStore` grew `store_symbol_defs` /
  `resolve_symbol` / `_sweep_symbol_orphans` (WS2) and `delete_gene`
  without adapter counterparts, so any of those calls on a sharded store
  (`HELIX_USE_SHARDS=1`) raised `AttributeError` — caught by
  `test_adapter_covers_full_knowledgestore_surface`, which CI's
  file-scoped test selection never ran. `resolve_symbol` fans out across
  shards (soft-fail, deduped) like `term_doc_frequencies`; the three
  writes are V1 read-only-adapter no-ops, with `delete_gene` returning
  False so admin callers don't believe a hard-delete happened.

- **config: shipped `cymatix.toml` genome default back to
  `genomes/main/genome.db`.** The 2026-07-13 dogfooding commit pointed the
  shipped default at the dogfood genome (and broke
  `test_shipped_toml_matches_code_defaults`). Per-machine genome choice
  lives in the launcher's durable last-used selection
  (`~/.helix/launcher/selected_genome.json`, #286), which wins over the
  toml on every startup after the first — fresh installs get `main`,
  existing setups keep whatever they last selected.

- **fix(bench): `sweep_splade_scale_curve.py` on-arm never ran query-side
  SPLADE (#204).** The harness constructed `Genome(path=...,
  dense_embedding_enabled=False)` without threading `splade_enabled`, and
  the `KnowledgeStore` constructor default is `False` (config default is
  `True` — the #256-family layer-default disagreement biting a bench
  script). Tier 3.5 is gated on `self._splade_enabled`, so every
  "SPLADE-on vs off" delta this script ever reported — including the
  2026-07-11 overnight P9 smoke — was an A/A comparison, not a SPLADE
  ablation. The on-arm now constructs with `splade_enabled=True` and each
  arm's metrics embed a firing receipt (`splade_fire`: encode /
  query_splade call counts + hit totals) so artifacts self-certify that
  the tier engaged. Also adds `--query-shape raw|extracted` (`extracted` =
  stage-1 `extract_query_signals`, the serving shape — serving SPLADE
  encodes the extracted keyword bag, not the raw question; `raw` absolute
  levels are not serving-representative), plus
  `benchmarks/build_striptwins.py` (copy bed → `DROP TABLE splade_terms` →
  `VACUUM`, ~1 min/scale point) and the curated paraphrase gold-query
  fixture `benchmarks/_splade_curve_queries.json` (+ provenance sidecar).
  Curve results: `docs/research/2026-07-13-splade-scale-curve.md`.

- **fix(bench): seed sharded-fixture `harmonic_links` so cross-shard co-activation is reachable (#223).**
  `scripts/build_fixture_matrix.py --mode sharded` shipped every fixture
  with zero `harmonic_links` rows — `seed_edges()` existed but was
  test-only, leaving `ShardRouter._expand_cross_shard_coactivation` (#120)
  and the `coact_reserved_slots`/`coact_link_boost` knobs (#270)
  permanently unreachable in any sharded receipt. Now seeds intra-shard
  edges per shard (`seed_edges`) and cross-shard edges once across all
  shards (new `seed_cross_shard_edges`, bucketed by shared domain/entity
  token, bidirectional writes), both `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` and
  default-on (`HELIX_BFM_SEED_EDGES=0` to disable). `scripts/reseed_sharded_fixture.py`
  backfills an already-built fixture without a re-ingest. Re-run of the
  #223 A/B on a seeded medium fixture confirms `_apply_coact_reserve`
  now fires (previously unreachable); see issue #223 for the receipt.

- **fix(retrieval): harmonize `fusion_mode` layer defaults (#256).**
  `KnowledgeStore`/`Genome` direct construction now defaults
  `fusion_mode="rrf"`, matching `RetrievalConfig` (the #247 default flip).
  Config-built servers are unaffected (they always passed the config value
  explicitly); directly-constructed stores — including most test fixtures
  and micro-bench scripts — previously ran the legacy additive accumulator
  silently. Pass `fusion_mode="additive"` explicitly for legacy physics
  (scheduled for removal in v(N+2)). `test_layer_defaults_agree` now guards
  the two layers' equality permanently.

## 0.7.2b1 — 2026-07-06 (beta)

Efficiency + bench-validity wave. Beta cut for cross-host bench validation
(Max's box runs the trimmed local ladder; Joe's DGX Spark runs the heavy gemma4
rungs). Merge order: this bump lands **after** #241 (merged), #242, #243.

- **feat: fp32-BLOB SEMA embeddings + lean MCP surface (#241).** `genes.embedding`
  (20-d ΣĒMA) now packs as a little-endian fp32 BLOB in the same TEXT-affinity
  column — ~5x on that column, **no schema migration**, dual-decode keeps legacy
  JSON rows readable. MCP defaults to a lean 5-tool surface
  (`helix_context`/`_packet`/`_ingest`/`_health`/`_sessions_list`); set
  `HELIX_MCP_FULL=1` for the full 24 (~4–5K schema tokens/turn saved).
- **feat(server): `HELIX_DISABLE_LEARN` read-only serving (#243).** Skips Stage-6
  persist so answering a query never mutates the store — read-only / ephemeral /
  eval serving. Keystone fix for bench self-contamination (echo genes).
- **feat(bench): SIKE Run-1 validity + per-rung checkpoint/resume/pause (#243).**
  Decontaminated beds, probe A3 fixes, `SIKE_OLLAMA_MODELS` / `SIKE_SKIP_CLAUDE`
  ladder split, `sike_ctl.ps1` control, and a runner that checkpoints after every
  rung (a stop loses at most the in-flight rung).
- **fix(config): repair mojibake `helix.toml` (#242).** A UTF-8 BOM + double-encoded
  comments made the TOML parser fall back to code defaults; repaired to clean
  UTF-8 (config values unchanged).
- **docs:** efficiency/cost-reduction design memo (binary storage · algorithm-vs-model
  · MCP token cost), honesty baseline (encoder defaults are ON), root-tidy.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-06-09

- **fix(launcher): usable stdio under pythonw (#199).** The 0.7.0
  headless tray (`start-helix-tray.bat` via `pythonw`) failed to bind
  the dashboard port: detached pythonw has `sys.stdout`/`sys.stderr` =
  None and uvicorn's default loggers write to them, killing the
  launcher's server thread before bind (tray icon alive, dashboard
  dead, no traceback). `_ensure_streams()` now routes the missing
  streams into `--log-file` (or `os.devnull`) right after arg parsing.
  Caught during a live v0.7.0 install.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-06-09

Dashboard + UX release: the tray-hosted web dashboard graduates from a
read-only status page to the primary control surface, and the launcher
grows a dev/configuration dual-port mode. Driven by a live full-stack QA
session (clean-worktree boot, OTel routing verified end-to-end into
Prometheus / Tempo / Loki / Grafana).

- **feat(launcher): dev-mode dual main+bench ports (#197).**
  `[server] bench_enabled / bench_port (11439) / bench_genome_path` — the
  launcher supervises a second helix pinned to the bench genome via a
  per-instance env overlay, with its own state file, log, web controls
  (`/api/control/bench/start|stop`) and a dashboard card. Primary chat
  stays on the main genome/port; a subagent's bench-harness targets the
  bench port. Default OFF (`--bench` / `HELIX_BENCH_ENABLED=1`
  override) — final deployments get exactly one server. Verified live:
  ingest against :11439 lands only in the bench store.

- **feat(launcher): startup + first-boot UX (#197).** Alive-but-not-
  ready now renders a loading spinner ("encoders warming up") instead of
  "stopped"; when no genome exists at the active path the launcher skips
  autostart and the dashboard pops a select-or-create database dialog
  that dismisses itself once helix is up. `start-helix-tray.bat` goes
  headless via `pythonw` + new `--log-file` flag (python /B fallback).

- **feat(launcher): dashboard wiring sweep (#195).** Genome management
  from the web UI (`GET /api/genomes`, `POST /api/genome/select|create`,
  Select buttons + Create-and-switch form — heavy work on worker
  threads, 202 responses); Observability panel with per-service status
  dots + direct links to all six Grafana dashboards and Prometheus;
  `/api/state` carries the same snapshots for automation.

- **fix(store): fresh-checkout boot crash (#195).** `KnowledgeStore`
  mkdirs the genome's parent chain — a clean clone/worktree previously
  died with `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`
  behind a silent 90s supervisor timeout.

- **feat(obs): grafana sidecar hardening (#195).** Pinned to 127.0.0.1
  with anonymous Admin for the local single-operator surface (GF_*
  overrides win) — telemetry links land on dashboards, not a login
  wall. Prometheus pinned to 127.0.0.1:9090; update/analytics
  phone-home disabled. The duplicate `helix-overview` dashboard uid is
  now a real **Helix — Overview** entry point.

## 0.6.5 — 2026-06-09

Eleven PRs landed same-day on top of 0.6.4 — the open-PR backlog merge
train (#182–#190), the full-suite QA de-flake that validated it, and the
two storage fixes that came out of the #165 fingerprint-index audit.

- **perf(storage): path_key_index Option-B compaction (#165, #193).** The
  fingerprint-routing index was 34.1% of the v2 Onyx corpus; probes
  showed the live Tier-0 lookup never uses `idx_pki_lookup` (covering
  PK scan), 38% of rows sit in pairs above `PKI_NOISE_CUTOFF` (hard-
  skipped by the scorer — zero score contribution), and the rowid
  table + 3-col-PK autoindex stored every row twice. New DBs now create
  `path_key_index` WITHOUT ROWID and skip the dead index; existing DBs
  convert via `storage.indexes.compact_path_key_index` /
  `POST /admin/compact-pki` (transactional, dry-run supported; follow
  with `/admin/vacuum`). ~21% corpus reduction on the audit fixture,
  score-invariant (40/40-query ablation). Tier-0 scoring constants
  (`PKI_BASE/FLOOR/NOISE_CUTOFF`) moved to `storage.indexes` as the
  canonical home so the scorer and compactor cannot drift.

- **fix(sharding): MAX_PATH overflow guard (#192).** The mirrored
  corpus-shard layout could exceed Windows' 260-char MAX_PATH when deep
  source roots mirror under deep `genomes_root`s. `corpus_shard_db` now
  caps at `HELIX_SHARD_PATH_MAX` (default 240) and falls back to a
  deterministic `_overflow/<label>-<sha1[:10]>.genome.db`; resume/salvage
  and routing unaffected.

- **fix(tests): full-suite de-flake (#191).** Two suite-hangers fixed:
  the sharded-parity test no longer loads SPLADE+BGE-M3 in parent + both
  spawn workers (three CUDA contexts = the #176 WDDM livelock on <=12 GB
  rigs) — lean-ingest env kill-switches `HELIX_BFM_SPLADE` /
  `HELIX_BFM_DENSE_BACKFILL` force the lean path; the metrics atomicity
  test no longer does 200K locked disk persists. Four
  `test_observability_docs` contracts re-pinned to the README-v3 layout;
  WSL-relay `bash.EXE` probed before use (skip when non-functional).

- **feat(ingest): size-aware SPLADE auto-toggle (#164, #189).**
  `splade_auto_enable_below_genes` / `splade_auto_disable_above_genes`
  knobs in `[ingestion]` (default 0 = off, byte-identical) +
  `benchmarks/sweep_splade_scale_curve.py` scaffold.

- **feat(bench): dense_additive_weight sweep harness (#138, #188).**
  `benchmarks/sweep_dense_additive_weight.py` across {0.0–6.0} with
  `gold_evicted_vs_baseline`; w=0.0 pinned as a true dense-off floor.
  Default stays 4.0 pending EnterpriseRAG-class data.

- **feat(bench): auto-subshard large source roots (#147, #186).**
  `_decompose_oversized_root` splits any single-root shard above
  ~5 GB / 100K files along top-level subdirs; silent-fail logging
  guards; `enterprise_rag_500k` profile.

- **fix(packet): preserve source-type prefix in `<GENE src=...>`
  (#146, #185).** Path shortener now anchors on the last `sources/`
  segment so `confluence/...`, `gmail/...` prefixes survive verbatim.

- **fix(bench): BenchServer import-source identity guard (#153, #184).**
  Spawn pins cwd + PYTHONPATH to the repo root, logs the resolved
  `helix_context` path at RUN START, and probes the fixture schema
  before swap — wrong-worktree mismatches fail in milliseconds, not as
  `retr=err` x 50.

- **feat(bench): file-level resume + SIGINT pause-then-resume
  (#150/#151, #183).** Partial shards resume at the file boundary
  (`_filter_to_unseen`); Ctrl+C finishes the in-flight batch, writes a
  `.paused-at-*` checkpoint, exits cleanly; `--rebuild` restores
  nuke-and-start-fresh.

- **feat(hardware): GB10 / Grace+Blackwell launch-blocking shim
  (#190).** Opt-in `HELIX_CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1` forces synchronous
  CUDA launches before any torch import to dodge the sm_121
  async-dispatch livelock; byte-identical embeddings, default-off.
  Plus `docs/hardware/grace-blackwell.md`. (Contributed by @addiplus.)

- **docs(operations): dense ingest VRAM tuning matrix (#178, #182).**
  `docs/operations/DENSE_VRAM.md` — the <=12 GB / 16–24 GB / >=48 GB
  runbook with the confirmed failure modes and env-knob reference.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-06-09

Three landed PRs since v0.6.2. v0.6.3 remains the frozen Onyx
external-validation snapshot (tag-only, not on PyPI); 0.6.4 is the
public sibling that pulls forward the master-bound subset.

- **perf(dense): bound CUDA VRAM during batch ingest via periodic
  `empty_cache` (#177).** `BGEM3Codec.encode_batch` now releases
  torch's caching allocator every `HELIX_DENSE_VRAM_RELEASE_EVERY`
  batches (default 256, set `0` to disable). Holds dense ingest at
  ~6 GB plateau on a 12 GB 3080 Ti — previously climbed to 11.7 GB
  and spilled to shared-mem (the slow path that looked like a hang).
  Vectors are byte-identical (`empty_cache` only frees unused
  blocks). CUDA-only; CPU path untouched. Pairs well with
  `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` for
  fragmentation. Closes #176.

- **fix(config): wire `semantic_dense_additive_weight` +
  `semantic_broaden_routing` through retrieval (#180).** Two
  `RetrievalConfig` fields plus the consumer code that reads them
  — env-gated by `HELIX_SEMANTIC_ARM=1` AND `query_type ==
  "semantic"`, default-off so the stock path is byte-identical to
  v0.6.2. Lets downstreams running the v0.6.3 fixed-pipeline TOML
  compare arm-on vs arm-off on a master-derived build without the
  loader silently dropping their config keys. `query_type` is read
  from POST body on `/context` and `/fingerprint`. Backports JUST
  the semantic-arm hunks from the v0.6.3 chain — `_dense_w` swap in
  `knowledge_store`, LIKE-gate bypass in `shard_router.route()`,
  `query_type` thread through `build_context` /
  `build_context_async` / `_retrieve`. Explicitly NOT included:
  question-conditioned dense, fp16 matrix, RAM-cap PRAGMAs,
  IN-clause batching.

- **feat(launcher): Manage Database tray submenu + dashboard
  switchboard + pipeline viewer (#179).** Three connected launcher
  features:
  - System-tray "Manage Database ▸" submenu discovers genome `.db`
    files under `genomes/**` / `benchmarks/` / repo root, shows the
    active marker, per-genome sub-submenu with folder breakdown
    sampled from `source_id`, and a one-click "Use this database
    (restart helix)" action that sets `HELIX_GENOME_PATH` and
    restarts the supervised helix on a background thread so the
    pystray pump stays responsive. Win32 `MessageBoxW` confirmation
    on Windows (avoids the tkinter-on-pystray-thread deadlock);
    tkinter fallback elsewhere.
  - Dashboard **Switchboard** panel surfaces 11 operationally-
    interesting retrieval/budget/classifier/ribosome knobs from
    `load_config()` so an operator can read the live pipeline shape
    without `cat helix.toml`.
  - Dashboard **Pipeline viewer** (dev-mode toggle, default on)
    renders the last ~20 `build_context()` calls with per-stage
    timings. Backed by a `contextvars`-scoped per-request id and a
    bounded `_pipeline_events` deque in `context_manager`
    (`HELIX_PIPELINE_RING=0` disables) + new
    `GET /debug/pipeline/recent`.
  - New `GET /admin/genome` reports the `.db` the running helix
    actually opened; the dashboard cross-checks it against the
    on-disk registry so drift between "selected" and "running" is
    visible.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-05-30

Make the v0.6.1 SQLite memory posture **host-aware** instead of unconditionally
conservative. v0.6.1 hard-coded `mmap_size=0` + 2/4 MB page caches on every host
as a 100-shard fan-out commit guard — but the BGE-M3 model singleton was the
actual 120 GB → 7 GB fix, so that I/O posture only over-throttled RAM-rich hosts
(reading 46 GB of shards through a 4 MB cache with mmap off). This scales the
per-shard `mmap_size` / `cache_size` to the host.

- **perf(memory): RAM-aware SQLite budget, `HELIX_MEM_PROFILE` (default `auto`).**
  `hardware.sqlite_memory_budget(n_shards)` derives a per-connection
  `mmap_size` / `cache_size` from *available* RAM: `budget = (available − 25%
  reserve) / n_shards`, split into file-backed mmap (≤ 2 GiB/shard) + a bounded
  2–64 MB page cache. Because the budget is a fraction of free RAM, it can never
  claim more than exists, and it self-throttles when shard count is high or RAM
  is scarce (the 105-shard / 48 GB stress case falls back toward mmap-off). The
  plan is resolved once in `ShardRouter` from the registered shard count and
  threaded into each shard's `KnowledgeStore` + `main.db`; standalone stores
  resolve a single-DB budget.
  - `HELIX_MEM_PROFILE`: `auto` (default) · `aggressive` (15% reserve, 4 GiB cap)
    · `conservative` (**byte-identical to v0.6.1** — the escape hatch) · `<N>gb`
    (pin the total SQLite budget, host-independent — useful where psutil
    over-reports inside a constrained container).
  - Hard overrides: `HELIX_SQLITE_MMAP_SIZE` (bytes) and `HELIX_SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE`
    (raw pragma value) win over the profile.
  - PRD: `docs/prds/2026-05-30-dynamic-ram-scaling.md`. Unit-tested (budget
    contract + plan-application through Genome / ShardRouter / main.db); the
    end-to-end 100-shard perf delta is validated separately on the bench fixture.

## 0.6.1 — 2026-05-30

Performance release: concurrent shard fan-out + a daemon RAM collapse at
100-shard scale. Both land off the EnterpriseRAG-Bench v2 work (850K genes /
100 shards) and were verified end-to-end on that fixture (resident RAM
~120 GB → 7 GB; per-query 125s → 57.6s median at `HELIX_SHARD_WORKERS=8`;
0 daemon deaths; ranked output byte-identical to the serial path).

- **perf(memory): share ONE BGE-M3 model process-wide (PR #173).**
  `KnowledgeStore._get_dense_codec()` built its own ~2 GB `BGEM3Codec` per
  instance, so a query touching ~100 shards loaded up to ~100 copies of the
  model — the dominant driver of the daemon's 47 GB-on-disk → ~120 GB-resident
  ramp (legitimate heap is only ~6 GB). `get_shared_codec()` returns one
  instance per `(model_name, dim, device)`; inference is stateless so sharing
  across concurrent fan-out workers is safe (double-checked load lock). Default
  on; `HELIX_SHARE_DENSE_CODEC=0` reverts to per-instance for an A/B.

- **perf(retrieval): concurrent shard fan-out (PR #172).** The 100-shard
  fan-out in `ShardRouter.query_genes` ran as a serial loop. It now parallelizes
  the per-shard fetch (open + `query_docs` + IDF probe) via a
  `ThreadPoolExecutor` — the dense matmul releases the GIL through BLAS, so
  threads genuinely parallelize, with BLAS pinned to 1 thread (`threadpoolctl`)
  to avoid oversubscription. Accumulation/merge/sort stays sequential in
  original shard order, so ranked output is byte-identical to serial. Gated by
  `HELIX_SHARD_WORKERS` (default 1 = serial). Pair with the BGE-M3 singleton —
  without it the per-shard model duplication thrashes the pagefile and caps the
  speedup at ~1.5x.

- **perf(memory): optional fp16 dense matrix (PR #173).**
  `HELIX_DENSE_MATRIX_DTYPE=float16` halves the resident per-shard dense matrix
  (~3.3 GB → ~1.65 GB); numpy promotes to fp32 inside the matmul so cosine
  precision is unchanged. Default `float32` = byte-identical to 0.6.0.

- **perf(memory): bound SQLite memory + guard mmap (PR #173).** Explicit
  `cache_size` caps on both per-shard connections (−2 MB writer / −4 MB reader;
  previously the unbounded 2 MB/conn default × 200 connections) and explicit
  `PRAGMA mmap_size=0` on every connection (writer/reader/main.db) as a process-
  commit guard for concurrent shard opens under fan-out.

- **fix(retrieval): WAL checkpoint on shard close (PR #172).**
  `ShardRouter.close()` now calls `genome.close()` (which runs
  `checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) instead of closing the connections directly, which
  skipped the checkpoint and left up to 64 MB of un-truncated WAL per shard.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-05-28

Substantial release covering corpus-scale retrieval, bench rebuilding,
storage audits, and a stack of stability + portability fixes. Headline
work: EnterpriseRAG-Bench (Layer 3) shipped with 100q variant-A
results (recall@10 = 28% on the 850K-gene v2 fixture); two scaling-wall
bugs (regex ReDoS at ingest, SQL-variable cap at retrieval) fixed and
cross-validated on x86 + ARM64 hardware; ~400 lines of new bench docs.

- **fix(tagger): eliminate catastrophic backtracking in `_KV_PAIR_PATTERN`
  (PR #155 / PR #162).** Pre-fix, `(\w+(?:_\w+)*)` had redundant
  nested-quantifier ambiguity that triggered catastrophic backtracking on
  underscore-heavy content. A single worker spinning on
  `tagger.py:439`'s `_KV_PAIR_PATTERN.finditer(content[:5000])` hung the
  EnterpriseRAG-Bench-Onyx-full corpus build for 60+ minutes on a single
  google-drive shared-drives file (underscore-rich JSON keys like
  `expected_doc_ids`, `data_source_id`). The fix `(\w+)` is functionally
  identical (same match set, since `\w` includes `_`) but has no nested
  quantifier. Verified on the 3 worst-offender files from the bench corpus:
  0.40-0.52 ms each, down from >60 min hung. 200-underscore stress test:
  0.02 ms. **Cross-validated** under two independent py-spy investigations
  on different hardware classes (x86 Ryzen + RTX 3080 Ti on 2026-05-19,
  ARM64 Grace + GB10 on 2026-05-27) — same line, same root cause, same fix.

- **perf(ddl): skip FTS5 orphan cleanup when delta is < 5% of gene count
  (PR #156 / PR #162).** The previous cleanup ran
  `DELETE FROM genes_fts WHERE gene_id NOT IN (SELECT gene_id FROM genes)`
  — an O(N·M) correlated subquery that hung the daemon's first-query
  response for hours on the 850K-gene / 105-shard EnterpriseRAG-Bench
  fixture. On a single 18K-gene shard with ~40 orphans (0.2% noise) the
  `NOT IN` scan pegged a core for 5-10 minutes against a cold OS-cache
  page set. Orphan FTS5 entries are harmless at query time (downstream
  `gene_id` joins return NULL and filter out before delivery), so
  skipping cleanup for trivial deltas costs nothing in retrieval quality
  and unblocks first-query latency entirely. For the rare significant-drift
  case (delta ≥ 5%), the rewritten query uses indexed `NOT EXISTS` instead
  of `NOT IN`, turning O(N²) into O(N log N). Daemon `/health` response
  on the 850K-gene fixture went from "hangs forever" to milliseconds.

- **feat(build): salvage already-complete shards on rebuild (PR #157 /
  PR #162).** Adds `_try_salvage_complete_shard()` which opens an existing
  shard `.db` read-only, verifies the `genes` table has 100% dense
  backfill coverage and no live WAL sidecar, and returns the same
  result-dict shape that `_build_one_shard` would normally produce —
  letting the parent's `_commit_shard_result` re-register the shard via
  `INSERT OR REPLACE`. Designed for the kill+restart cycle: if
  `build_fixture_matrix.py` is interrupted (Ctrl+C, OOM, planned restart),
  fully-complete shards on disk are re-registered in seconds instead of
  rebuilt from scratch. Verified at scale: 21 of 22 already-complete
  shards re-registered into a fresh `main.genome.db` in 2 min 19 sec
  (vs ~13 hours to rebuild from scratch) during a mid-build restart of
  the EnterpriseRAG-Bench-Onyx-full 850K-gene build.

- **fix(knowledge_store): batch IN-clause queries to stay under SQLite cap
  (PR #163).** SQLite caps `WHERE col IN (?, ?, ...)` placeholders at
  `SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER` (999 legacy, 2000 on the Python 3.12 /
  SQLite 3.50 builds we ship to, 32766 on newer compile defaults). Four
  call sites on the `gene_scores` fan-out path in `query_docs`
  (`_apply_authority_boosts`, sema-boost embedding lookup, party-attribution
  lookup, access-rate epigenetics lookup) build the IN clause from a
  caller-determined candidate set that can exceed the cap in production.
  Observed in the 2026-05-28 v2-fixture 100q bench: 3 of 29 queries had a
  per-shard query raise `OperationalError: too many SQL variables`, which
  the daemon's per-shard try/except swallowed as "shard X query failed;
  skipping" — biasing recall@K by silently dropping shards. Variants where
  SPLADE or the prefilter narrows `gene_scores` don't hit this; only the
  no-filter SPLADE-off path produces sets large enough to blow up. Adds
  `_iter_in_batches(items, batch_size=500)` helper and refactors the four
  hot sites. Includes TDD'd regression test at
  `tests/test_knowledge_store_batched_in.py` that probes the runtime cap
  via `conn.getlimit(SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER)` and exercises at
  `cap`, `cap + 1`, and `4*cap + 7` boundaries.

- **fix(mcp): registry handshake is best-effort, don't kill subprocess on
  failure (PR #169).** On Windows, `claude -p` MCP attempts were failing
  with "Connection closed" after ~2 s even when helix was alive on
  `http://127.0.0.1:11437`. Root cause: `_register_with_registry()` was
  called synchronously before `mcp.run()` entered the stdio handshake; an
  exception from `register_participant()` (auto-heartbeat thread init,
  etc.) propagated out of `main()` and killed the MCP subprocess before
  the host could complete its handshake. The registry is not load-bearing
  for tool calls — tool calls proxy directly to the helix HTTP API.
  Registry is only used by `helix_announce` + dashboards. This patch
  wraps `_register_with_registry()` in a try/except inside `main()`:
  happy path unchanged, failure path logs the exception and continues
  to `mcp.run()` rather than exiting. Closes #167.

- **feat(bench): add `--isolated` flag to `bench_claude_matrix` for
  leak-free measurement (PR #170).** When set, the `claude -p` sub-agent
  is launched with `--tools ""` (all built-in tools disabled),
  `--strict-mcp-config`, and `--mcp-config '{"mcpServers":{}}'` (no MCP
  servers). Pair with a sterile `--cwd` (e.g. `F:/tmp/bench_sandbox`) to
  also block CLAUDE.md auto-discovery. Isolates retrieval-driven answer
  quality from filesystem-tool access. Records `isolated` + `claude_cwd`
  in the per-run JSON so post-hoc analysis can distinguish leak-free runs
  from contaminated runs. Brings shipped code into agreement with
  shipped docs (`docs/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md` §"Layer 3 —
  EnterpriseRAG-Bench" and `BENCHMARK_RATIONALE.md` addendum already
  described this isolation mode). Closes #168.

- **docs(benchmarks): add Layer 3 (EnterpriseRAG-Bench) + EnterpriseRAG
  fixtures (PR #166).** ~400 lines across four files. `BENCHMARKS.md`
  gets a new "Layer 3 — EnterpriseRAG-Bench" section covering the
  2026-05-20→21 bench investigation rebuild (`isolated=True` mode,
  +32.4 pp helix lift, 65% hallucination reduction), cross-corpus results
  (60% recall@10 @ 10K → 71% @ 50K → 28% @ 850K), the expression-budget
  clamp fix (4%→43% correctness), Wall-1 / Wall-2 scaling-wall framing,
  the v2 100q variant-A result table, and cross-host validation of the
  tagger fix. `GENOME_FIXTURE_MATRIX.md` gets a new EnterpriseRAG-Bench
  fixtures section (5-row fixture table, shared 9-source-root scope,
  excluded-from-ingest list, auto-subsharding behavior, path-portability
  gotcha, branch/PR routing). `BENCHMARK_RATIONALE.md` gets an addendum
  on how Layer 3 answered the rationale's NIAH-doesn't-fit problems.
  `MULTI_VALID_GOLD.md` gets an EnterpriseRAG-Bench gold-path matching
  section (schema diff, `_rel_after_sources` normalization, prefix-tolerant
  match fix).

### Prior work consolidated into this release

The following entries were already in `## Unreleased` at the start of
this release cycle and ship together as part of 0.6.0:

- **fix(launcher): `[headroom] route_upstream` is now a separate, default-off
  config knob; routing no longer happens implicitly from "upstream is remote".**
  Pre-fix, `_should_route_helix_upstream_via_headroom` returned True for any
  remote (non-loopback) upstream as long as `HELIX_HEADROOM_ROUTE_UPSTREAM_AUTO`
  wasn't explicitly set falsy. So an operator with `cfg.server.upstream =
  "https://api.openai.com/v1"` and `cfg.headroom.enabled = false` (defaults!)
  would have the launcher rewrite `HELIX_SERVER_UPSTREAM` to
  `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and start helix pointing at a Headroom proxy that
  was never started — every chat call then failed with ECONNREFUSED, with
  no clear diagnostic. `route_upstream` is now an explicit `[headroom]` bool
  (default `false`) gating the rewrite. `HELIX_HEADROOM_ROUTE_UPSTREAM_AUTO`
  remains as a per-launch override (truthy → on, falsy → off, unset →
  defer to config). The existing test
  `test_remote_upstream_routes_helix_via_headroom` (which pinned the buggy
  behavior) is replaced with four tests covering the new precedence rules.

- **fix(launcher): `POST /api/control/start` no longer reports success on a
  hung backend; returns `202 Accepted` with `started_pending=true`.** PR #68
  made `supervisor.start()` non-fatal on `/stats` timeout (proc left
  running so the tray's next poll picks it up). The REST handler still
  treated this as success and returned `{ok: true, pid}`, so external
  automation hitting `/api/control/start` directly couldn't distinguish
  ready from alive-but-not-ready. New `supervisor.last_start_pending`
  flag flips on the timeout path; REST surface returns 202 with a
  `started_pending: true` field and a hint to poll `/api/state` or
  `GET /stats`. Same treatment on `/api/control/restart`. Closes #72.
- **fix(hardware): summary `WARNING` line when explicit-device probe
  falls back to CPU.** The tray fires a balloon, but headless deployments
  (server, supervisor-managed, agents) miss that signal. `_detect()` now
  emits one `log.warning("Hardware fallback: requested=X active=cpu — ...")`
  alongside the per-candidate probe failures so operators tailing logs
  see the cause in line-of-sight. `auto`→cpu is unchanged (not noteworthy).
  Closes #65 SF2 — SF1, SF3, SF4 were already addressed on master
  (per-rewrite log.info, `cost_class` in `/health` + Prometheus info
  metric + startup WARN, and the WAL-bloat section in
  `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` + `/admin/checkpoint` admin endpoint).

- **fix(api): `open_session()` now honors `HELIX_CONFIG` / `HELIX_GENOME_PATH`.**
  Pre-fix, every cold-start CLI subcommand (query, diag corpus, packet,
  gene, neighbors, refresh-targets) called `HelixConfig()` (defaults) and
  silently created/read `./genome.db` regardless of what the operator had
  configured — so `helix status` looked at the configured genome but
  `helix query` looked at an empty one. Now routes through `load_config()`
  the same way `helix status` does. Surfaced by AI-user testing on
  `93deaf2`.
- **fix(status): bump `/health` probe timeout default 1.5s → 10s, override
  via `HELIX_STATUS_TIMEOUT_S`.** Cold-start `/health` can take 5-10s
  under model warmup + manager init + WAL replay; the old 1.5s timeout
  silently reported a healthy-but-slow server as `unreachable` in
  `helix status --json`.
- **fix(mcp): unwrap the Continue list shape in `helix_context` /
  `helix_document_query` tools.** `POST /context` returns the
  Continue-IDE HTTP context-provider list (`[{name, description, content,
  ...}]`) so the FastAPI endpoint stays drop-in compatible with Continue.
  MCP hosts validate tool returns against the declared `Dict[str, Any]`
  schema and rejected the list. New `_unwrap_context_list` helper flattens
  the single-entry list, passes error envelopes through, and wraps
  unexpected shapes with a diagnostic note.
- **fix(config): auto-fallback `ingestion.backend` → `"cpu"` when
  `ribosome.enabled = false`.** The two settings contradict each other —
  ingest with the ribosome disabled raised
  `TranscriptionError: Pack failed: Ribosome is disabled` on the first
  chunk. `load_config()` now flips ingestion to the spaCy/heuristic
  CpuTagger path and logs a WARNING. Honors explicit `cpu` / `hybrid`
  settings without override.
- **feat(cli): `python -m helix_context.cli` works as a console-script
  fallback.** Adds `helix_context/cli/__main__.py` so an agent or
  operator with a broken pip-installed `helix.exe` (deleted editable
  source path, Scripts dir off PATH) always has a module-direct
  invocation. Documented in `docs/clients/cli.md`.

- **feat(cli): agent walk-aware surface — `packet` / `gene` / `neighbors` /
  `refresh-targets`.** Four new subcommands that complete the v1 CLI as a
  full agent surface — agents drive genome lookups via subprocess CLI
  calls instead of MCP-injected context. JSON shapes match the
  corresponding HTTP endpoints (`/context/packet`, `/genes/<id>`,
  `/debug/neighbors`, `/context/refresh-plan`) and MCP tools
  (`helix_context_packet`, `helix_gene_get`, `helix_neighbors`,
  `helix_refresh_targets`) so callers can swap surfaces without changing
  call logic. Read-only by default (no genome mutation from inspection).
- **feat(api): walk-aware methods on `HelixSession`.** `gene_get`,
  `packet`, `refresh_targets`, `neighbors` — previously deferred to v1.1
  per `helix_context/api.py:352-360`, now in v1 to back the CLI surface
  above. Pure in-process wrappers over `Genome.get_gene`,
  `build_context_packet`, and the existing SEMA codec; no HTTP server
  required.
- **docs: README — agent-CLI callout + benchmark sourcing.** New "Agent
  CLI surface (no server required)" section advertises the CLI as a
  first-class agent surface alongside MCP, with the full subcommand
  surface inline. The "28.7× headline / 5.4× median" claim now cites the
  reproducer at `benchmarks/bench_rag_vs_sike_tokens.py` and the
  methodology doc at `docs/benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md`; the overnight
  result file referenced in the README-v2 spec is documented as internal.
- **docs: ROSETTA — response-types section, dead-entry fix, ChromatinState
  note.** Adds a "Response & routing types (STAYS — no biology twin)"
  section covering `ContextWindow`, `ContextPacket`, `KnowBlock`,
  `MissBlock`, `RefreshTarget`, `ContextHealth`, `ContextItem`,
  `QueryResult`, `IngestResult`, `StatsResult`. The `HGT →
  cross_store_import` row is annotated as a forward-pointer (no code under
  either name today). The `OPEN/EUCHROMATIN/HETEROCHROMATIN →
  OPEN/WARM/COLD` row notes the rename is deferred to R3 because
  `ChromatinState` in `schemas.py` still emits the bio names.

- **feat(cli): v1 cold-start CLI shipped.** `helix query`, `helix ingest`,
  `helix status`, `helix diag corpus`, `helix config show`. Mocked unit
  tests for every subcommand plus a live `@pytest.mark.live` integration
  test against an `:memory:` genome. The legacy FastAPI launcher is now
  reachable as `helix-server` (previous `helix` entry point). Daemon
  (`helix serve`) remains deferred per `docs/architecture/HELIX_DAEMON_DESIGN.md`
  — the subcommand prints a pointer and exits 4. See `docs/clients/cli.md`
  for the operator reference.
